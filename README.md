**CogniRAG-AI** is a production-grade, multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic Workflow Engine designed to process complex technical documents, multilingual scripts (Urdu, Roman Urdu, and English), and enterprise agreements.

It combines intelligent document retrieval, agentic intent routing, automated web search fallbacks, and evaluation-driven guardrails to deliver reliable, context-aware, and grounded responses.

## **🌟 Key Features**

- **Multilingual & Multi-Script Support:** Processes and retrieves information from PDF, CSV, TXT, DOCX, and XLSX documents, including English, Native Urdu (Nastaliq script), and Roman Urdu content.

- **Agentic Intent Routing & Web Fallback:** Automatically evaluates local retrieval confidence. When relevant information is unavailable in internal documents, it dynamically triggers web search using the Tavily API.

- **Isolated Vector Store Architecture:** Implements strict `thread_id`-based session isolation in ChromaDB to prevent cross-contamination between different document sessions and users.

- **Ragas Benchmarking & Evaluation:** Evaluates system performance using enterprise-oriented metrics, including Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy, Context Precision, and Context Recall.

- **Grounded Response Generation:** Uses retrieved document context to generate evidence-based responses and reduce unsupported answers.

- **Agentic Workflow Management:** Leverages LangGraph for structured state management, conditional routing, and dynamic workflow execution.

## **🏗️ System Architecture & Workflow**

CogniRAG-AI follows an agentic RAG architecture that intelligently determines whether a query can be answered using internal documents or requires external web search.

## **📊 Evaluation Results (Ragas Benchmark)**

CogniRAG-AI was evaluated using multilingual datasets containing employee handbooks, technical specifications, and financial contracts.

| Evaluation Metric | Score |
|---|---:|
| Faithfulness | **1.0000** |
| Context Precision | **1.0000** |
| Context Recall | **1.0000** |
| Answer Relevancy | **0.8532** |

**Evaluation Highlights:**

- **Faithfulness (1.0000):** All evaluated responses were consistent with their retrieved contexts.
- **Context Precision (1.0000):** Retrieved contexts were relevant to the evaluated queries.
- **Context Recall (1.0000):** Relevant information was successfully retrieved in the evaluation dataset.
- **Answer Relevancy (0.8532):** Responses demonstrated strong relevance to user queries.

*Note: These scores represent results on the tested evaluation dataset and do not guarantee zero hallucinations or perfect retrieval in every production scenario.*

## **⚙️ Local Installation & Setup**

Follow these steps to run CogniRAG-AI locally.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cognirag-ai.git
cd cognirag-ai
```

### **2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

**Windows:**

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the additional Windows-specific file-locking dependency:

```bash
pip install "portalocker[win32]"
```

### **4. Configure Environment Secrets**

Create the following file:

```text
.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

Add your API credentials:

```toml
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
TAVILY_API_KEY = "your_tavily_api_key_here"
ENVIRONMENT = "production"
```

`GROQ_API_KEY` is required. `TAVILY_API_KEY` is optional; without it, document Q&A remains available but web search fallback is disabled. You can also set these keys in a `.env` file in the project directory.

**Important:** Never commit your API keys or secrets to a public GitHub repository.

### **5. Run the Application**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will start locally and provide a URL in your terminal.
